Dear {name},

I hope this message finds you well.

I'm Atharva Pudale, a DevOps Engineer passionate about automating cloud infrastructure and streamlining CI/CD workflows. I recently completed my B.E. in Computer Engineering and bring hands-on experience in building production-ready systems using AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and ArgoCD.

During my internship at Autocal Systems, I developed reusable Terraform modules, automated multi-environment EKS deployments, and implemented full-stack observability using Prometheus and Grafana—leading to a 40% increase in infrastructure efficiency.

I'm currently looking for an opportunity to contribute to a team that values cloud-native solutions, infrastructure as code, and continuous delivery. I’ve attached my resume for your reference and would appreciate the chance to discuss how I can bring value to your organization.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
Atharva Pudale
